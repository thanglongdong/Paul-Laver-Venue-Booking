    <h4>Your Obligations</h4>
    <p>1. You are solely responsible for the provision of the Space and any Services to Guests. We have no obligation to Venues or to Guests other than the provision of the Platform.</p>
    <p>2. You are responsible for ensuring that your Space is suitable for the purpose for which you make it available for use by Guests and ensuring that it will not cause any work, health or safety issues for Guests.</p>
    <p>3. You may offer to provide to Guest the Additional Services in respect of your Spaces. Additional Services are to be managed through the Platform with the assistance of our customer care team.</p>
    <p>4. For Online Booking methods of listing, a booking for the Services is confirmed when the Guest receives a confirmation email that the booking has been confirmed by the Venue Partner. The booking confers the Guest a licence to access and use your Space for the period specified in the booking. In this period, you must allow the Guest to access and use your Space without interference and interruption. Your obligations to the Guest are no different to those that you would have had you hired, leased or rented your Space on a more formal basis to the Guest.</p>
    <p>5. You must comply with our Guidelines as published from time-to-time on the Platform. We may terminate or suspend your registration if you fail to comply with our Guidelines.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h4>Our Obligations</h4>
    <p>1. We will provide you with access to the Platform.</p>
    <p>2. We may, at any time, enhance and/or alter the features of the Platform at our sole discretion and without notice to you.</p>
    <p>3. We will engage a reputable third-party online payment facilitator to enable a Guest to pay for the Services without us collecting or storing their financial details. In order to receive payment, you will be required to set up an account with the third-party online payment facilitator as it will be through this account that we pay amounts owed to you.</p>
    <p>4. We are not responsible for and make no promise about the quality of the payment facilitator or the benefit to be derived from use of the payment facilitatorâ€™s services.</p>
